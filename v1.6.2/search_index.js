ProxSDP solves general SDP problems by means of a first order proximal algorithm based on the primal-dual hybrid gradient, also known as Chambolle-Pock method. The main advantage of ProxSDP over other state-of-the-art solvers is the ability of exploit the low-rank property inherent to several SDP problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Overview-of-problems-ProxSDP-can-solve","page":"Home","title":"Overview of problems ProxSDP can solve","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Any semidefinite programming problem in standard form;\nSemidefinite relaxations of nonconvex problems, e.g. max-cut, binary MIMO, optimal power flow, sensor localization;\nNuclear norm minimization problems, e.g. matrix completion.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installing","page":"Home","title":"Installing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Currently ProxSDP only works with Julia 1.0.x","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To add ProxSDP run:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"pkg> add ProxSDP","category":"page"},{"location":"#Referencing","page":"Home","title":"Referencing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The first version of the paper can be found here.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"@article{souto2018exploiting,\n  title={Exploiting Low-Rank Structure in Semidefinite Programming by Approximate Operator Splitting},\n  author={Souto, Mario and Garcia, Joaquim D and Veiga, {\\'A}lvaro},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.05231},\n  year={2018}\n}","category":"page"}]
