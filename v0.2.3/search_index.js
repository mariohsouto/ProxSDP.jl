ProxSDP solves general SDP problems by means of a first order proximal algorithm based on the primal-dual hybrid gradient, also known as Chambolle-Pock method. The main advantage of ProxSDP over other state-of-the-art solvers is the ability of exploit the low-rank property inherent to several SDP problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Overview-of-problems-ProxSDP-can-solve-1","page":"Home","title":"Overview of problems ProxSDP can solve","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Any semidefinite programming problem in standard form;\nSemidefinite relaxations of nonconvex problems, e.g. max-cut, binary MIMO, optimal power flow, sensor localization;\nNuclear norm minimization problems, e.g. matrix completion.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installing-1","page":"Home","title":"Installing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Currently ProxSDP only works with Julia 1.0.x","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To add ProxSDP run:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"pkg> add ProxSDP","category":"page"},{"location":"#Referencing-1","page":"Home","title":"Referencing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The first version of the paper can be found here.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"@article{souto2018exploiting,\n  title={Exploiting Low-Rank Structure in Semidefinite Programming by Approximate Operator Splitting},\n  author={Souto, Mario and Garcia, Joaquim D and Veiga, {\\'A}lvaro},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.05231},\n  year={2018}\n}","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#Manual-1","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/#Building-problems-with-JuMP.jl-1","page":"Manual","title":"Building problems with JuMP.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"Currently the easiest ways to pass problems to ProxSDP is through JuMP or MathOptInterface.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"In the test folder one can find MOI implementations of some problems: MIMO, Sensor Localization, Random SDPs and sdplib problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#Solver-arguments-1","page":"Manual","title":"Solver arguments","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"Argument Description Type Values (default)\nlog_verbose print evolution of the process Bool false\nlog_freq print evoluition of the process every n iterations Int 100\ntimer_verbose Outputs a time logger Bool false\ntime_limit Maximum time the algorithm can try to solve in seconds Float64 360000.0\nmax_iter Maximum number of iterations Int 1000000\ntol_primal Primal error tolerance Float64 1e-3\ntol_dual Dual error tolerance Float64 1e-3\ntol_psd Tolerance associated with PSD cone Float64 1e-15\ntol_soc Tolerance associated with SOC cone Float64 1e-15\ninitial_theta Initial over relaxation parameter Float64 1.0\ninitial_beta Initial primal/dual step ratio Float64 1.0\nmin_beta Minimum primal/dual step ratio Float64 1e-4\nmax_beta Maximum primal/dual step ratio Float64 1e+4\nconvergence_window Minimum number of iterations to update target rank Int 200\nmax_linsearch_steps Maximum number of iterations for linesearch Int 1000\nfull_eig_decomp Flag for using full eigenvalue decomposition Bool false","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#JuMP-example-1","page":"Manual","title":"JuMP example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"A quick JuMP example:","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"using ProxSDP, JuMP\n\n# Create a JuMP model using ProxSDP as the solver\nmodel = Model(with_optimizer(ProxSDP.Optimizer, log_verbose=true))\n\n# Create a Positive Semidefinite variable\n@variable(model, X[1:2,1:2], PSD)\n\nx = X[1,1]\ny = X[2,2]\n\n@constraint(model, ub_x, x <= 2)\n@constraint(model, ub_y, y <= 30)\n@constraint(model, con, 1x + 5y <= 3)\n\n# ProxSDP supports maximization or minimization\n# of linear functions\n@objective(model, Max, 5x + 3 * y)\n\n# Then we can solve the model\nJuMP.optimize!(model)\n\n# And ask for results!\nJuMP.objective_value(model)\n\nJuMP.value(x)\nJuMP.value(y)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#Referencing-1","page":"Manual","title":"Referencing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"The first version of the paper can be found here.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"@article{souto2018exploiting,\n  title={Exploiting Low-Rank Structure in Semidefinite Programming by Approximate Operator Splitting},\n  author={Souto, Mario and Garcia, Joaquim D and Veiga, {\\'A}lvaro},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.05231},\n  year={2018}\n}","category":"page"}]
